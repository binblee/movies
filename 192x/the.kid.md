# The Kid (1921)

The Kid is a 1921 American silent comedy-drama film written by, produced by,
directed by, and starring Charlie Chaplin, and features Jackie Coogan as his
adopted son and sidekick. This was Chaplin's first full-length film as a
director (he had been a co-star in 1914's Tillie's Punctured Romance). It was a
huge success, and was the second-highest grossing film in 1921, behind The Four
Horsemen of the Apocalypse. In 2011, The Kid was selected for preservation in
the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being
"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant." Innovative in its
combination of comedic and dramatic elements, The Kid is widely considered one
of the greatest films of the silent era.

### Production
The Kid is notable for combining comedy and drama. As the opening title says: "A picture with a smile-and perhaps, a tear." The most famous and enduring sequence in the film is the Tramp's desperate rooftop pursuit of the agents from the orphanage who had taken the child, and their emotional reunion.

The film made Coogan, then a vaudeville performer, into the first major child star of the movies. Many of the Chaplin biographers have attributed the relationship portrayed in the film to have resulted from the death of Chaplin's firstborn infant son just before production began. The portrayal of poverty and the cruelty of welfare workers are also directly reminiscent of Chaplin's own childhood in London. Several of the street scenes were filmed on Los Angeles's famed Olvera Street, almost 10 years before it was converted into a Mexican-themed tourist attraction.

After production was completed in 1920, the film was caught up in the divorce actions of Chaplin's first wife Mildred Harris, who sought to attach Chaplin's assets. Chaplin and his associates smuggled the raw negative to Salt Lake City (reportedly packed in coffee cans) and edited the film in a room at the Hotel Utah. Before releasing the film Chaplin negotiated for and received an enhanced financial deal for the film with his distributor, First National Corporation, based on the success of the final film.

Lita Grey, who portrays an angel in the film, was Chaplin's second wife from 1924 to 1927.

In 1971, Chaplin edited and reissued the film and he composed a new musical score.

Chaplin and co-star Coogan met for the last time in 1972, during Chaplin's brief return to America for an Honorary Academy Award.

### Legacy
Chaplin biographer Jeffrey Vance writes, of the legacy of Chaplin's The Kid: "The Kid remains an important contribution to the art of film, not only because of Chaplin’s innovative use of dramatic sequences within a feature-length comedy, but also because of the revelations The Kid provides about its creator. Undoubtedly, when Chaplin penned the preface to The Kid, “A picture with a smile--and perhaps, a tear,” he had his own artistic credo—and life—in mind." Mary Pickford said of the film, "The Kid is one of the finest examples of the screen language, depending upon its actions rather than upon subtitles".
